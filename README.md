# Finals_Project
This is the last project on my course in codeacademy.

I decided to find a dataset on Kaggle.com. It contains 299 people who are victims of heart failure. It contains multiple conditions 
that may contribute to heart failure happening. I manipulated the data to achieve the four goals I had wanted:
      1. Which gender has more heart failure victims?
      2. How many victims have both high blood pressure and diabetes?
      3. How many victims are fifty and under and have anaemia?
      4. What is the percentage of heart failure victims who pased away?

I was able to finish my findings in Jupyter Labs. If you have any advice for me, it would be greatly appreciated!
